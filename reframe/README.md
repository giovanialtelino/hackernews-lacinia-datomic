# hackernews-reframe

A [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame) application designed to emulate the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) site with GraphQL.

## Getting Started

Well, to run the front-end in this repo, you pretty much have to clone it to your computer, and run "lein dev", if for some reason you want to build it, just run "lein prod".

There are still features to be added, like editing comments, and also the website doesn't have any of the HN "[hidden](https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-undocumented)" features, I probably wont'be dealing with those, but feel free to push any request if you want to, or just clone it and do your stuff.

## Back-end

Keep in mind that this is just the front-end of the app, the back-end is located [here](https://github.com/giovanialtelino/hackernews-lacinia-datomic).

## Manual testing

If you want to login after dealing with the back-end you can use one of the default accounts like:  
User: 1@com.com Password: pwd1

Or you can also create an account with any kind of fake e-mail.
