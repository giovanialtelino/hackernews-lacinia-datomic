The rest of the vector's\n  elements are optional, additional values which parameterise the query\n  performed.\n\n  `dynv` is an optional 3rd argument, which is a vector of further input\n  signals (atoms, reactions, etc), NOT values. This argument exists for\n  historical reasons and is borderline deprecated these days.\n\n  Example Usage:\n  --------------\n\n    (subscribe [:items])\n    (subscribe [:items \\\"blue\\\" :small])\n    (subscribe [:items {:colour \\\"blue\\\"  :size :small}])\n\n  Note: for any given call to `subscribe` there must have been a previous call\n  to `reg-sub`, registering the query handler (function) for the `query-id` given.\n\n  Hint\n  ----\n\n  When used in a view function BE SURE to `deref` the returned value.\n  In fact, to avoid any mistakes, some prefer to define:\n\n     (def <sub  (comp deref re-frame.core/subscribe))\n\n  And then, within their views, they call  `(<sub [:items :small])` rather\n  than using `subscribe` directly.\n\n  De-duplication\n  --------------\n\n  XXX\n  \"\n\n  ([query]\n   (trace/with-trace {:operation (first-in-vector query)\n                      :op-type   :sub/create\n                      :tags      {:query-v query}}\n     (if-let [cached (cache-lookup query)]\n       (do\n         (trace/merge-trace! {:tags {:cached?  true\n                                     :reaction (reagent-id cached)}})\n         cached)\n\n       (let [query-id   (first-in-vector query)\n             handler-fn (get-handler kind query-id)]\n         (trace/merge-trace! {:tags {:cached? false}})\n         (if (nil? handler-fn)\n           (do (trace/merge-trace! {:error true})\n               (console :error (str \"re-frame: no subscription handler registered for: \" query-id \".

And, at that time, re-frame\n  needs to know how to create the node.   By calling `reg-sub`, you are registering \n  'the template' or 'the mechanism' by which nodes in the Signal Graph can be created. \n\n  Repeating: calling `reg-sub` does not create a node. It only creates the template\n  from which nodes can be created later. \n  \n  `reg-sub` arguments are:  \n    - a `query-id` (typically a namespaced keyword)\n    - a function which returns the inputs required by this kind of node (can be supplied  in one of three ways) \n    - a function which computes the value of this kind of node \n\n  The `computation function` is always the last argument supplied and it is expected to have the signature: \n    `(input-values, query-vector) -> a-value`\n  \n  When `computation function` is called, the `query-vector` argument will be the vector supplied to the \n  the `subscribe` which caused the node to be created. So, if the call was `(subscribe [:sub-id 3 \\\"blue\\\"])`, \n  then the `query-vector` supplied to the computaton function will be `[:sub-id 3 \\\"blue\\\"]`.\n\n  The arguments supplied between the `query-id` and the `computation-function` can vary in 3 ways, \n  but whatever is there defines the `input signals` part of the template, controlling what input \n values \\\"flow into\\\" the `computation function` gets when it is called. \n\n  `reg-sub` can be called in one of three ways, because there are three ways to define the input signals part.\n  But note, the 2nd method, in which a `signal-fn` is explicitly supplied, is the most canonical and instructive. The other \n  two are really just sugary variations. \n\n  1. No input signals given:\n      ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n\n     In the absence of an explicit `input-fn`, the node's input signal defaults to `app-db`\n     and, as a result, the value within `app-db` (a map) is\n     is given as the 1st argument when `a-computation-fn` is called.   \n \n\n  2. A signal function is explicitly supplied:\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       signal-fn     ;; <-- here\n       computation-fn)\n     ```\n     \n     This is the most canonical and instructive of the three variations.\n     \n     When a node is created from the template, the `signal-fn` will be called and it\n     is expected to return the input signal(s) as either a singleton, if there is only\n     one, or a sequence if there are many, or a map with the signals as the values.\n\n     The values from returned nominated signals will be supplied as the 1st argument to  \n     the `a-computation-fn` when it is called - and subject to what this `signal-fn` returns, \n     this value will be either a singleton, sequence or map of them (paralleling\n     the structure returned by the `signal-fn`).\n\n     This example `signal-fn` returns a vector of input signals.\n       ```clj\n       (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n         [(subscribe [:a-sub])\n          (subscribe [:b-sub])])\n       ```\n     The associated computation function must be written\n     to expect a vector of values for its first argument:\n       ```clj\n       (fn [[a b] query-vec]     ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n         ....)\n        ```\n\n     If, on the other hand, the signal function was simpler and returned a singleton, like this:\n        ```clj\n        (fn [query-vec dynamic-vec]\n          (subscribe [:a-sub]))\n        ```\n     then the associated computation function must be written to expect a single value\n     as the 1st argument:\n        ```clj\n        (fn [a query-vec]       ;; 1st argument is a single value\n          ...)\n        ```\n \n     Further Note: variation #1 above, in which an `input-fn` was not supplied, like this:\n       ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       a-computation-fn)   ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n     is the equivalent of using this\n     2nd variation and explicitly suppling a `signal-fn` which returns `app-db`:\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :query-id\n       (fn [_ _]  re-frame/app-db)   ;; <--- explicit input-fn \n       a-computation-fn)             ;; has signature:  (fn [db query-vec]  ... ret-value)\n     ```\n \n  3. Syntax Sugar\n\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :a-b-sub\n       :<- [:a-sub]\n       :<- [:b-sub]\n       (fn [[a b] query-vec]    ;; 1st argument is a seq of two values\n         {:a a :b b}))\n     ```\n\n     This 3rd variation is just syntactic sugar for the 2nd.  Instead of providing an\n     `signals-fn` you provide one or more pairs of `:<-` and a subscription vector.\n\n     If you supply only one pair a singleton will be supplied to the computation function, \n     as if you had supplied a `signal-fn` returning only a single value:\n\n     ```clj\n     (reg-sub\n       :a-sub\n       :<- [:a-sub]\n       (fn [a query-vec]      ;; only one pair, so 1st argument is a single value\n         ...))\n     ```\n\n  For further understanding, read `/docs`, and look at the detailed comments in\n  /examples/todomvc/src/subs.cljs\n  \"\n  [query-id & args]\n  (let [computation-fn (last args)\n        input-args     (butlast args) ;; may be empty, or one signal fn, or pairs of  :<- / vector\n        err-header     (str \"re-frame: reg-sub for \" query-id \", \")\n        inputs-fn      (case (count input-args)\n                         ;; no `inputs` function provided - give the default\n                         0 (fn\n                             ([_] app-db)\n                             ([_ _] app-db))\n\n                         ;; a single `inputs` fn\n                         1 (let [f (first input-args)]\n                             (when-not (fn? f)\n                               (console :error err-header \"2nd argument expected to be an inputs function, got:\" f))\n                             f)\n\n                         ;; one sugar pair\n                         2 (let [[marker vec] input-args]\n                             (when-not (= :<- marker)\n                               (console :error err-header \"expected :<-, got:\" marker))\n                             (fn inp-fn\n                               ([_] (subscribe vec))\n                               ([_ _] (subscribe vec))))\n\n                         ;; multiple sugar pairs\n                         (let [pairs   (partition 2 input-args)\n                               markers (map first pairs)\n                               vecs    (map last pairs)]\n                           (when-not (and (every? #{:<-} markers) (every? vector? vecs))\n                             (console :error err-header \"expected pairs of :<- and vectors, got:\" pairs))\n                           (fn inp-fn\n                             ([_] (map subscribe vecs))\n                             ([_ _] (map subscribe vecs)))))]\n    (register-handler\n      kind\n      query-id\n      (fn subs-handler-fn\n        ([db query-vec]\n         (let [subscriptions (inputs-fn query-vec)\n               reaction-id   (atom nil)\n               reaction      (make-reaction\n                               (fn []\n                                 (trace/with-trace {:operation (first-in-vector query-vec)\n                                                    :op-type   :sub/run\n                                                    :tags      {:query-v    query-vec\n                                                                :reaction   @reaction-id}}\n                                                   (let [subscription (computation-fn (deref-input-signals subscriptions query-id) query-vec)]\n                                                     (trace/merge-trace! {:tags {:value subscription}})\n                                                     subscription))))]\n\n           (reset! reaction-id (reagent-id reaction))\n           reaction))\n        ([db query-vec dyn-vec]\n         (let [subscriptions (inputs-fn query-vec dyn-vec)\n               reaction-id   (atom nil)\n               reaction      (make-reaction\n                               (fn []\n                                 (trace/with-trace {:operation (first-in-vector query-vec)\n                                                    :op-type   :sub/run\n                                                    :tags      {:query-v   query-vec\n                                                                :dyn-v     dyn-vec\n                                                                :reaction  @reaction-id}}\n                                                   (let [subscription (computation-fn (deref-input-signals subscriptions query-id) query-vec dyn-vec)]\n                                                     (trace/merge-trace! {:tags {:value subscription}})\n                                                     subscription))))]\n\n           (reset! reaction-id (reagent-id reaction))\n           reaction))))))\n"]}
